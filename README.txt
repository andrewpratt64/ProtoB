Work-in-progress "Prototype B" of RPKG TOOL

>>> Open with Visual Studio 2019 <<<

Some code here is unfinished and/or dosen't entirely reflect the final version of the program

The "ProtoBCodeGen" project isn't currently used, I'm most likely deleting it later

I'm currently trying to implement ProtoB.Controls.SubentityTree, it wasn't working so I made FooControl to test a simple version of it. That one dosen't work right either :)

There's a lot of ugly "unsafe {}" code segments in ProtoB, the ViewModels should abstract those details
